# Feature Specification: Personal CRM System

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-personal`  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a Personal CRM for my friends and family that keeps track of all my personal relationships and helps me remember to stay in touch with pepople on a weekly, monthly, quarterly, biannually or annual basis. This will also allow me to add notes to iteractions, reminds me of their birthday (gives me a week warning, and on the day) as well as stores critical phone, email and address information for each contact. This system will help me stay organised and maintain my relationships over the long term."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a person who values maintaining personal relationships, I want to systematically track my interactions with friends and family members so that I can stay consistently connected with them and never forget important details about their lives. The system helps me remember to reach out regularly based on customizable schedules, reminds me of birthdays, and stores essential contact information and interaction notes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have added a contact with a "monthly" communication preference, **When** 30 days pass since my last recorded interaction, **Then** the system notifies me to reach out to that person
2. **Given** I have a contact with a birthday set for next week, **When** 7 days before their birthday, **Then** the system sends me a birthday reminder notification
3. **Given** I just had a conversation with a friend, **When** I add interaction notes about what we discussed, **Then** the notes are saved and associated with that contact and timestamp
4. **Given** I need to contact someone, **When** I view their contact details, **Then** I can see their phone, email, and address information along with recent interaction history
5. **Given** it's someone's birthday today, **When** I check my dashboard, **Then** I see a birthday notification for that person

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a contact has no communication preference set?
- How does the system handle leap year birthdays?
- What if I want to temporarily pause reminders for a contact?
- How does the system handle contacts with missing birthday information?
- What happens when I have multiple phone numbers or email addresses for one contact?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to add, edit, and delete contact records
- **FR-002**: System MUST store contact information including name, phone numbers, email addresses, and physical addresses
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to set communication frequency preferences (weekly, monthly, quarterly, biannually, annually) for each contact
- **FR-004**: System MUST track the date of last interaction for each contact
- **FR-005**: System MUST send reminders when it's time to contact someone based on their communication frequency
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to add timestamped notes about interactions with contacts
- **FR-007**: System MUST store birthday information for contacts
- **FR-008**: System MUST send birthday reminders 7 days before a contact's birthday
- **FR-009**: System MUST send birthday notifications on the actual birthday
- **FR-010**: System MUST display a dashboard showing upcoming reminders and recent interactions
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow users to mark when they have contacted someone to reset their communication timer
- **FR-012**: System MUST support searching and filtering contacts by various criteria
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain a history of all interactions and notes for each contact
- **FR-014**: System MUST allow users to temporarily disable reminders for specific contacts
- **FR-015**: System MUST handle multiple phone numbers and email addresses per contact

*Areas requiring clarification:*
- **FR-016**: System MUST support single-user operation where one person manages their personal relationship network on their own devices, with data syncing across their multiple devices (phone, tablet, computer) but not shared with other users.
- **FR-017**: System MUST support multiple notification methods including push notifications on mobile devices for immediate alerts, email summaries for weekly planning, and in-app dashboard notifications for when users are actively using the system. Users MUST be able to configure their preferred notification methods and timing.
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide complete data export functionality allowing users to download all their contact information, interaction notes, and relationship history in standard formats (CSV, JSON, or vCard) for backup purposes or migration to other systems. Export MUST be available at any time without restrictions.
- **FR-019**: System MUST handle timezone considerations by storing birthdays in the contact's local timezone when known, but displaying reminders and scheduling notifications based on the user's current timezone. For contacts without specified timezones, system MUST default to user's timezone. Users MUST be able to specify timezone preferences for each contact.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Contact**: Represents a person in the user's network with attributes like name, contact information, birthday, communication preference, and relationship notes
- **Interaction**: Represents a recorded communication or meeting with a contact, including date, type, and notes about what was discussed
- **Reminder**: Represents scheduled notifications for communication or birthdays, with status tracking and snooze capabilities
- **Communication Frequency**: Defines how often the user wants to be reminded to contact specific people (weekly, monthly, quarterly, biannually, annually)
