# Feature Specification: Google Contacts Sync Integration

**Feature Branch**: `002-google-contacts-sync`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Google Contacts Sync Integration"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature: Google Contacts Sync Integration
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: CRM users, Google Contacts API
   ‚Üí Actions: sync, import, export, bidirectional updates
   ‚Üí Data: contact information, sync status, mapping
   ‚Üí Constraints: API rate limits, data consistency
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: connect Google account, sync contacts, manage conflicts
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (sync status, mapping data)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a Personal CRM user, I want to synchronize my contacts with Google Contacts so that my contact information stays consistent across platforms and I can leverage existing Google contacts without manual data entry.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user has existing contacts in Personal CRM, **When** they connect their Google account and initiate sync, **Then** their CRM contacts are uploaded to Google Contacts
2. **Given** user has contacts in Google Contacts, **When** they perform initial sync, **Then** Google contacts are imported into Personal CRM with proper mapping
3. **Given** user updates a contact in Personal CRM, **When** sync runs, **Then** the corresponding Google contact is updated with the same information
4. **Given** user updates a contact in Google Contacts, **When** sync runs, **Then** the corresponding Personal CRM contact is updated
5. **Given** conflicting changes exist in both systems, **When** sync runs, **Then** user is presented with conflict resolution options

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Google API rate limits are exceeded?
- How does system handle contacts with no matching fields between systems?
- What occurs when Google account authentication expires?
- How are deleted contacts handled in bidirectional sync?
- What happens when a contact exists in both systems with different information during initial sync?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to authenticate with their Google account using OAuth
- **FR-002**: System MUST perform bidirectional synchronization between Personal CRM and Google Contacts
- **FR-003**: System MUST detect and handle sync conflicts by presenting resolution options to users
- **FR-004**: System MUST map contact fields between Personal CRM and Google Contacts formats
- **FR-005**: System MUST track sync status and last sync timestamps for each contact
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle API rate limiting gracefully with appropriate retry mechanisms
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to enable/disable automatic sync
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide manual sync trigger option
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve existing Personal CRM contact data structure and relationships
- **FR-010**: System MUST log sync activities for audit and troubleshooting purposes
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle authentication token refresh automatically
- **FR-012**: Users MUST be able to disconnect their Google account and stop syncing
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide sync status indicators in the contact interface
- **FR-014**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: sync frequency not specified - real-time, hourly, daily, user-defined?]
- **FR-015**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: data retention policy for sync logs not specified]
- **FR-016**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: handling of Google contact groups/labels not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Sync Status**: Tracks synchronization state for each contact (synced, pending, conflict, error)
- **Contact Mapping**: Links Personal CRM contacts with Google Contacts using unique identifiers
- **Sync Log**: Records sync activities, conflicts, and errors for audit purposes
- **Google Auth Token**: Stores authentication credentials for Google API access
- **Conflict Resolution**: Temporary storage for conflicting contact data requiring user resolution
